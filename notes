Im my opinion we should use restfull end points in order to have a stardardzed way of going about writing our endpoints.
I think this we make the code more readable and easier for everyone to understand the code.

I also think that the data base class should have 2 functinalites that the server class uses 
1. Get json information about programs and users
2. validate querys against the data base if valdiation fails return false



END POINT FORMAT:
self explanitory
/login
/logout
/register



on the front end a request would be in the format
/<type>/<typeid>/optionalattribute

so a get of uri /users/
returns all users

a post to uri /users/ should contains json detailing a new user
and apon sucess should return the newly created user

a GET TO /users/1
returns the user with id 1

a DELETE TO /users/1 should 
remove the user and return either sucess or an error code not found or forbidden.

to update a field of a user a PUT should be used.

An example would be to promote a user to a staff

 a PUT /user/1/staff
tries to promote/demote the user and return either sucess or an error code not found or forbidden.

to obtain parameterized urls in flask use "/<parameter>" in the route name
then when defining the function use def functname(parameter)
flask should auto fill parameter with the value from url
